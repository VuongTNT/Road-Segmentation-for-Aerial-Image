# Road-Segmentation-for-Aerial-Image
Semantic segmentation has become a foundational task in the field of computer vision, with applications ranging from medical image analysis to autonomous driving
and satellite imagery interpretation. Among these, road segmentation from aerial
and satellite imagery plays a critical role in geographic information systems (GIS),
urban planning, and navigation technologies.
Manual annotation of roads is not only time-consuming and labor-intensive but
also prone to human error. Hence, automating this process using deep learning
methods has become increasingly appealing. However, road segmentation poses
several challenges: roads are often thin, winding, and can be partially occluded by
shadows, trees, or buildings. This requires models capable of precise localization
and high spatial resolution to effectively distinguish roads from similar-looking
background elements.
